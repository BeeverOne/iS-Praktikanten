Below is a cleaned up list of ideas for our project, please let me know was dir gefällt;

**1. Exhibit Content Control Dashboard**

- **What it is:** A simple web-based interface to organize and preview content (images, text, videos) used in exhibits.
- **Key Features:**
  - Add and edit exhibit items through a clean, user-friendly layout.
  - See how changes would look on a display screen.
- **Why it matters:** Could connect later to real systems controlling what museum visitors see.

**2. Show Scheduling & Trigger Interface**

- **What it is:** A timeline-based tool to schedule events (like turning on a light, playing a sound) at certain times.
- **Key Features:**
  - Drag-and-drop events on a time bar.
  - Simulate “running” a sequence and see what would happen when.
- **Why it matters:** Helps plan out a timed show or presentation, which is common in museums or installations.

**3. Device Status & Monitoring Panel**

- **What it is:** A webpage that displays a list of “devices” (projectors, speakers, lights) and their current status.
- **Key Features:**
  - Turn devices on/off with buttons.
  - Visual indicators for device health.
- **Why it matters:** Mimics a control room dashboard that could eventually talk to real hardware.

**4. Simple Interactive Map (2D or Light 3D)**

- **What it is:** A floor plan view with clickable hotspots showing info about each exhibit area.
- **Key Features:**
  - Hover or click to reveal details about what’s in a room.
  - Easy to navigate and understand.
- **Why it matters:** Gives a simple way to understand the layout of a space, which can be valuable in planning or guiding visitors.

**5. Basic Media Asset Management Tool**

- **What it is:** A simple system to list and categorize images, videos, and sounds used in exhibits.
- **Key Features:**
  - Search, filter, and tag files.
  - Preview thumbnails or basic metadata.
- **Why it matters:** Helps organize media assets, something that can scale up to a real content management system.
